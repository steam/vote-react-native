A simple React Native application for figuring out where to vote using the
[Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information).

## Highlights

The Vote app uses the
[Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information) to lookup
polling locations for the entered address. Most results come from the
[Voting Information Project](https://www.votinginfoproject.org/).

All 1st party code is written in Typescript using functional components and react hooks.
Application state utilizes a modified React Context pattern inspired by Kent C. Dodds'
blog post
[How to use React Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).
